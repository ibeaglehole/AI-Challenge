**Welcome to FeelFlow: Your Emotion Tracking Journal App!**

FeelFlow is a journaling app facilitated by natural language processing algorithms to help users identify their emotions throughout the day. Sentiment analysis performed on both voice recordings and transcripted text allow the user to understand how well they process events in their life. The front-end was developed using the `streamlit` Python library, while the back-end used the GPT-3 API and `sklearn` models.
